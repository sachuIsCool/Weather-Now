# Weather Now

A minimal React + Vite app for quickly checking current weather conditions using Open-Meteo and Nominatim.

## Features
- Search a city name and get current temperature, wind, and conditions
- Uses Nominatim for geocoding and Open-Meteo for weather
- Clean, responsive UI with Tailwind CSS

## Run locally
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Then open the printed local URL (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

## Run on CodeSandbox or StackBlitz
- Import this folder into CodeSandbox or StackBlitz
- Ensure the start command is `npm run dev`

## Notes
- Geocoding uses the public Nominatim endpoint per its usage policy with a simple User-Agent.
- No API keys are required.
